# 📜 Manifesto – serverless-api-layers

> A declaration of purpose, principles, and philosophy behind the framework.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**serverless-api-layers** exists to simplify the creation of structured, scalable, and secure data services in the cloud.

Modern development should not be limited by infrastructure complexity or boilerplate overload. This framework gives developers the tools to define data, logic, and APIs with precision, while abstracting away operational burdens.

Our mission is to empower developers to focus on their business logic, not on wiring up AWS.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Declarative over imperative**: define what you want, not how to do it.
- **Data-first mindset**: start with your schema, everything else flows from it.
- **Validation is default**: every input and output must be trusted and structured.
- **Entity-centric**: organize logic around your business entities.
- **Serverless by nature**: scale elastically, deploy without ops.
- **Secure by default**: rate limits, auth, and namespace isolation are built-in.
- **Composable**: small building blocks, big possibilities.

## 🧩 Core Principles

1. **One definition = multiple layers**  
   Define once, and get API, validation, storage, and future events connected.

2. **Your model is the source of truth**  
   Zod-powered schemas drive type safety, validation, and structure across the system.

3. **All data access is explicit**  
   No magic. Every query, mutation, or trigger is defined and visible.

4. **No runtime patching**  
   Everything is defined statically. We generate infra and logic from source.

5. **Scale from day one**  
   Built on AWS with support for real production use cases and pricing models.

## 🌍 Vision

The future of backend development is:

- Schema-driven
- Event-reactive
- Minimal to configure
- Powerful to extend
- Invisible when it should be

**serverless-api-layers** will support:

- `defineEvent()` — react to any cloud event (DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, etc.)
- `defineInfrastructure()` — generate serverless.yml or CDK constructs
- `generateClient()` — auto-create frontend SDKs from API schemas
- `definePolicy()` — fine-grained auth and resource-based access controls

---

## 🙌 Final Words

We’re not building just a framework. We’re building a new **mental model** for how backend logic should be structured, validated, and deployed in the cloud era.

If it’s structured data, it belongs in **serverless-api-layers**.

Let’s build better backends.
